I used PyTest for testing the features. The project is

The website uses a mySQL database hosted on JawsDB for storing the texts and
their respective top scores. The backend was built with NodeJS and ExpressJS. I used VueJS for
the frontend. The web app is deployed on Heroku.

There are currently 1000 texts available. Each text is taken directly from
Typeracer through their <a href="http://typeracerdata.com/texts">database</a>. For storage
reasons, only the top three scores are saved.
